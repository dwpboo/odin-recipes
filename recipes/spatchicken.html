    <h2>What's the point of spatchcocking a chicken?</h2>
    <p>I bloody love roasting up a chicken and having it ready to go for all sorts of random meals throughout the week. But with a couple of kids running around I don't have the time to bung it in the oven for the best part of two hours.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul> 
    <li>Whole Chicken</li>
    <li>Sharp ass knife</li>
    <li>Olive oil</li>
    <li>Seasoning, I personally go Salt and Pepper so it's a base for loads of meals</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>pre-heat oven to 220c</li>
        <li>Get rid of the backbone of the chicken</li>
        <li>Flatten that bird out and be sure to break the wishbone</li>
        <li>Get that bird in a tray and oil it up and season</li>
        <li>get it in the oven and dont touch it for 45 mins!</li>
        <li>leave it to rest a little, and dont forget to use those jammy juices from the pan</li>
    </ol>
