This project is intended to apply the knowledge learnt on the HTML section of the Odin project. 

Hopefully all goes according to plan and I follow through with this. 

I haven't got to the full lesson description, but I reckon it'll be a series of pages linked together and some images of decent looking food.

We'll see.
